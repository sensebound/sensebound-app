 The scent of rain wafts through the air, damp and earthy, a reminder of the storm that's brewing outside. My eyes slowly open, and I'm met with the soft glow of the morning light, a gentle warmth that seeps into my skin. The sound of raindrops hitting the roof is a soothing melody, a lullaby that's been playing in the background of my dreams. I reach out to touch the cool glass of the window, feeling the condensation trickling down my fingers. The taste of rain on my tongue is a subtle hint of freshness, a promise of a new day. As I sit up, the bed creaks beneath me, a familiar sound that's been a constant companion in my dreams. The smell of damp earth and ozone fills my nostrils, a primal scent that awakens something deep within me. The world outside is still, a quiet stillness that's a balm to my frazzled nerves. I take a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill my lungs, and slowly, I come to.
